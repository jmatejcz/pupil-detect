## PUPIL AND GAZE ESTIMATION

This project was done as part of my engineering thesis.
It is implementation of the pupil segmentation using neural networks, and a three-dimensional eye-modeling algorithm by Lech Swirski and Neil Dodgson.

### Further work

Currently this implementation was used to get results from ground truth tests and does not provide use for wider applications.
In the future i might add functionality to use it with any videos/sets of images.
